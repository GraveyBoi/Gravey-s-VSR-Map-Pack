I didnt even have more than two empty scouts at a time, and only got to use a pair ONCE. The other time I was just holding them for teammates, who couldnt even be BOTHERED to realize when I passed them, or had COMPLETE LACK OF AWARENESS navigating the space within the base while we were under attack.
My commanding that game was generally speaking quite traditional, and we were only TECH CENTER away from full tech; I shouldnt be faulted when our entire team was in ships and yet repeatedly failed to respond to a base attack.
In fact, I should be credited, as my AI scouts managed to perform more defensive role than most of our team. 
The only reason we lost is because Mort is a cunning rat who knows just how to chew at the foundations of an enemy base.
